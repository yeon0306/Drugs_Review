"""I have been on this birth control for one cycle. After reading some of the reviews on this type and similar birth controls I was a bit apprehensive to start. Im giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as I have not been on it long enough for a 10. So far I love this birth control! My side effects have been so minimal its like Im not even on birth control! I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great! I got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and I had no idea it was coming because I had zero pms! My period was very light and I barely had any cramping! I had unprotected sex the first month and obviously didn't get pregnant so I'm very pleased! Highly recommend""",0
"""I absolutely love this product and recommend to everyone. I know everyone's body is different, so it is not for everyone, but it is not the medicines fault. I have NO negative symptoms since I started this. I used to have heavy periods, terrible cramps and headaches, and my periods were super long. I now have super consistent 3-4 LIGHT periods, no cramps or headaches. I have been on this pill for over a year now and have no desire to switch.""",0
"""I started on the oral contraceptive pill but got horrible nausea and vomiting, so this was my next option. NuvaRing has been fantastic, it has a fraction of the hormones and I get no nausea. Insertion and removing is really not a hassle, and you cannot feel it at all. For me, it beats the pill and vomiting, along with all the other symptoms. I haven't had any noticeable mood issues or migraines. I would recommend it to anyone!""",0
"""I started off by taking regular Ortho Tri Cyclen, which helped some with my acne, but I also became severely depressed, so I went off it.  After a year and a half of not taking birth control at all, I began taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for acne, and after 4 months my skin is MUCH clearer.  If I do get pimples, they are much smaller and more shallow than before, and go away quicker.  I am pleased!""",0
"""honestly the measurement hurt more than the actual placement! And I'm so happy I went through with it!!! I wish I didn't read all of these reviews before I did it. Pain is subjective and its not that bad. They explained the procedure to me and I felt more comfortable. I've never had kids. Its just like getting a regular pap. I think it is the best option of birth control. That being said I will definitely recommend getting this! Do expect cramping for a day or two. I didnt cramp until about three hours after having it done. I took ibuprophen and slept with a heating bad. Very mild cramping today but I am happy with my choice :)""",0
"""I just started taking this birth control about 12 days ago when I started my period, and I'm still bleeding as if I'm still on my period. The flow is light however the length of my average period is 2 weeks when I wasn't on birth control. So maybe the medication is altering my system %u2026I do feel nauseous and I crave like crazy. I do feel a little depressed because my period isn't gone yet but overall it 
seems to be a good birth control so far. """,0
"""I read so many bad experiences and horror stories about this pill, I was terrified. I am now on my second week of Aviane and have no symptoms.""",0
"""This is the third day I've had skyla and so far my experience has been excellent. I'd suggest taking ibuprofen all throughout the day and put a heating pad on your stomach (what i did). The procedure was uncomfortable and painful (i cried) but so far, extremely worth it. The day after I got it the bleeding significantly reduced, and today it's hardly bleeding. First day was the worst but definitely doable. As far as being emotional. The first day I was very irritable but I'm assuming it was because I was hurting and hungry all day. Other than that I've been great!""",0
"""I went in to have my Skyla placed yesterday morning. After reading all of these reviews I was hyperventilating and crying on my way there, bc I did not want to experience ""the worst pain of my life"". However, it was a complete waste of tears and energy. Before the procedure, I started doing heavy breathing, similar to pregnancy breaths, bc I was so nervous and I can tell you I felt NOTHING. There was a little bit of pressure, but nothing compared to what I've read on here. Probably a 2/10. It was over in 30 seconds, and as soon as she was done, the pressure vanished. I was shocked. I went to work from 5:45-11:30, & I managed with mild cramping.I cant speak for long term yet, but don't let other women scare you out of this, its very worth it!""",0
"""I have had my Paragard for one year, and it's been great! Insertion was not pleasant, but it only lasts a moment and now it's nothing but a distant memory. My periods were heavier and my cramps more severe for the first three months, but after that they returned to nearly the same as before. So many people wrote about their terrible experiences that reading up almost stopped me from doing it, and now I'm so glad I got it anyway. Just remember that those who had a negative experience are more likely to post about it, so there's a bias! It's also totally possible that it will go just fine and be a fantastic BC method. Don't be too afraid to try it and see if it's right for you, you can always take it out if it's not.""",0
"""I love Jolessa. I have no periods for three months and little to no side effects. I was on Depo for eleven years and due to insurance changes had to change to the pill.""",0
"""Ive been on this pill for 9 months now and I love it! I have severe migraines so it is hard to find a birth control that doesnt make them 10x worse. My migraines have almost disappeared since I started this pill! Also, I had one period upon starting the pills and I havent had one since. In the beginning of my trial, I did go through some changes. I was moody all the time, my breasts stayed sore to the extent that I could hardly move around. Other than that, I had no issues. I havent had any weight changes, acne changes or anything like that. My body returned to better than normal after maybe three months. Mood changes disappeared, no period, no cramps, no soreness. Overall I am satisfied!""",0
"""I've been on this birth control for a year and I have to say that it's very practical for my body. I used to get brutal cramps and long periods. No matter what type of birth control I had debilitating cramps. Lolo has caused my cramps to stop and my period is consistent and lasts 2 days. Only downside is I did get some acne, but the acne may be just due to something else since I've dealt with breakouts prior to trying lolo. Also my boobs grew a lot which I'm happy about. This medication is not for everyone, if you experience adverse effects stop taking it immediately as it does not agree with every woman.""",0
"""I have been using this method of Birth Control for over ten years now, I am hesitant to change to another form. I have not had a period since starting Depo and never had a pregnancy scare. I have gained weight while on the shot but it could be just my eating habits and lack of exercise! I would recommend this form of birth control for anyone who cannot remember to take a pill or who does not want to worry about getting pregnant. Once every three months is easy to do and I have never been happier with any form of birth control.""",0
"""I got nexplanon February 2015 at first my period was every 2 month which I loved. They are normal now. December 2015 I started gaining weight which I thought was just holiday so January I started exercising and lost 15 of the 30 pounds since I gained 10 back and and can't lose anything I diet exercise when ever my boyfriends not looking (I don't feel comfortable in front of him) and he's noticed the weight we got in a fight and he actually slipped up and called me fat. And said all I do is sit on my ass that's why I gained it. But I also got so depressed and cried over everything panic attacks every day and thought of self harm. The depression is gone now for the weight. I like it would give 10 stars except the depression and weight.""",0
"""I just got paragard not too long ago. And it was actually not as bad as I thought it would be. There was not excruciating pain at all. Just cramping. Anyone wanting to get it should most definitely do so. It's not as bad as some may say, but everyone reacts to things differently.""",0
"""I am 21 years old and have been on Depo-Provera for almost two years while in a four year committed relationship. My doctor recommended Depo-Provera for me because I suffer from chronic migraines so any birth control with a high level of estrogen would most definitely make my migraines worse. So far, I have to say I am pleased with my experience while on the depo shot. The side effects I have experienced have thankfully been able to be fixed/altered. Such as slight weight gain which I help to control with diet and exercise. Loss of sex drive which my longtime boyfriend is more than happy to help with. And I tend to start spotting around the time that my next shot is due. Once I receive the depo shot, within hours the spotting stops.""",0
"""I had terrible experiences on Alesse & Ortho Tri Cyclen so my doctor recommended Skyla (Jaydess in Canada) over Mirena for me because it's both smaller & releases a lower hormone amount since it lasts 3 years vs. 5 for Mirena. After reading the reviews here I was worried but wanted to try it anyway. There was a HUGE cramp after she measured my uterus & inserted the IUD, what I imagine a contraction feels like. I had lots of cramping afterwards for 2 weeks & on & off spotting for the first 3 months but that's all gone now. I'm really happy with Skyla, but every body is different.

Pros: shorter, lighter periods; no mood swings; no weight gain; no acne; no loss of sex drive
Cons: slightly worse pre-period cramps; occasional post sex cramping""",0
"""I aImost didn't go through after reading these reviews. I have had Liletta for about 2 months. I have no tolerance for pain whatsoever. I took a tramadol 2 hours before my appointment. My doctor advised that it would be painful for a short while especially since I have never been pregnant. She was very good during the insertion about letting me know when pain would occur. It was very painful for about 3-4 hours. After that, it was similar to my normal cramps for 2 days. I spotted for the first 4 days just enough for a panty liner, not even a pad, and have not had any spotting since. I have had no issues with my boyfriend and the strings or being dry ""down there"" as I have read with some others. My sex drive has increased since having it.""",0
"""I am 22 and I been on since I was 21, I havent had a period since I have been on, which is fine but my sex drive is out the window. Haven't had sex with my boyfriend in 6 weeks and we live together. I'm just not in the mood AT ALL. Also I notice I have been dry and that has never been the case. Also a lot of weight gain and no matter how much I exercise it wont come off. I also feel like my feet keeps growing. Its perfect for effectiveness but its the price you pay so to each its own. Different bodies react different ways so my story may not be yours.""",0
"""Having extreme lower back pain since having the nexplanon inserted. The pain is on the side left side where the nexplanon was inserted (left upper inner arm). Is anyone else experiencing this?""",0
"""This is the first and only birth control medication I've been on. I've been taking it a little over 2 years now. I've had no side-effects besides EXTREMELY low sex drive. I've never had a particularly high sex drive but now it's nonexistent. I haven't had any of the headaches or mood swings. There was a mild increase in my acne but I'm also a college student so I don't particularly lay all the blame on the pill. Overall, it does it's job but I would caution potential takers with low libido.""",0
"""The first month was bad. Breakthough bleeding.. cramping and bloating.. mood swings. But the second month was perfectly fine. I'm going onto my 3rd month now. Once my body got used to it everything was perfect. I love not having to remember to take a pill each day! This is so easy!""",0
"""I'm 18 and this is my first time being on birth control so when I read all the horrible reviews on Lutera I was really worried. But it's been about a week now and I can definitely say that I love it so far! Haven't had any side effects besides really bad nausea on the second day of the pill. But everything was fine after that. Haven't experienced any mood swings, decrease in sex drive. I've noticed that my appetite did increase just a little and my breasts have been more tender than usual.""",0
"""This pill did horrible things to me. I felt nauseous constantly and experienced severe anxiety. So much so, that I could not leave the house without crying. I was depressed and gained 8 pounds. All of this in less than a few months. I finally went off Tri Sprintec when I realized that it was causing me these side effects. Absolutely terrifying experience.""",0
"""LOVE IT! No complaints.""",0
"""Very positive experience.

I had previously used depo shots, so I knew going in that I would not have any harsh side effects. No headaches, spotting, weight gain or anything of that nature. Just a tiny dot scar where they inserted it. 

The entire process was quick and painless (I went to a very upscale and reputable establishment).""",0
"""I have been taking this for over 3 months. I have very light periods that only last a few days (which I love). I started taking this because I got back onto the Nuva ring after 3 years of using no method besides condoms. Although taken the ring in the past and loved it, it didn't work for my body this time and I ended up having an increased amount of breakthrough bleeding. So I asked my doctor for a low hormone bcp. I was skeptical at first because of my past experiences with the pill but I love it. My breasts and stomach feel sore and tender for most of the month, and sometimes I feel more tired than usual, but I love this pill and hope it works for you too!""",0
"""I've had the Nexplanon for 2 years. I had my period for a couple months and then nothing since. No cramping or spotting. I do have close to zero libido which I actually don't mind but obviously may be an issue for others.  Overall I'm satisfied with it.""",0
"""I started this medication when I was 15 because I had extremely painful, irregular, and stressful periods. I never knew when it would start or end, and I almost always had to miss at least one day of school per period. It sucked.
When I started this medication, I did notice some spotting for the first month of use. I then had my period and I never spotted again! 
It's been three years since I started this medication, and I've only gained 5 pounds in that time, so I'm assuming it's unrelated to the medication. I have not noticed any cravings, mood changes, or acne while on this medication.""",0
"""I have tried the pill, the patch, nuvaring, patch and the depo shot. I have to say the IUD has been my favorite! I did like the depo a lot but I broke out with a lot of acne all over my face. I never had acne as a teenager so getting it as an adult was torture and humiliating. I had to see a dermatologist and get on accutane. I then got the IUD in May 2011. I was nervous after reading reviews but decided I'd give it a shot anyway. Getting it inserted, I didn't realize how badly it hurt...after 30 days it felt great! I did have to get it trimmed once since my husband did hit it a few times. Other than that I highly recommend it. Best birth control I've tried by far! Give it a chance :)""",0
"""Just got marina inserted today. Was on bc for years tried pill patch etc. Hubby then got snip which failed but we are delighted with our little bundle of joy. Really did not know what to expect and was very nervous about insertion. I took ponston before hand and it did not hurt. Measurement went fine then when inserted felt something but very mild. Not like some reviews. So far so good but dont have it long enough to comment on side effects. Insertion not as bad as i expected. Will update in a few months time""",0
"""before my body adjusted i had really bad mood swings. when my first cycle on the pill came around it was a little unsettling to say the least. bad cramping. inconsistent dark blood. menstruation is no longer a hassle though as its practically stopped completely. no mood swings. no change in appetite. less acne. you might not match this pill if you continue to yeild undesirable results.""",0
"""Just had mine put in today and it wasn't as bad as I expected. There was was a little pressure upon insertion but otherwise it went like a normal yearly visit. My doc explained everything along the way and everything went great with only slight bleeding. I did get light headed and and slightly disoriented after but they cooled me down and am doing perfectly fine. So far only slight cramping experienced and very minimal bleeding.""",0
"""My experience: I'm 18 years old, and this birth control is amazing! Hardly use condoms with my spouse and I've been protected for 2 and half years. The only bad side, is the bleeding and discharge. I've been bleeding non stop and cannot tell what's my period and what's just blood. The other down side, is headaches and the blood! It's annoying to want to get intimate and have a pile of blood in your underwear. If you're looking for protection I highly recommend this, but if you mind bleeding and the other mishaps then try the pill!!""",0
"""Was on depo for a year prior to switching to nexplanon in 2012. For the first 2 and half years there were no periods. The the last couple months of the 3 years however unpredictable periods started of varying durations of up to almost 3 weeks. Next insertion will probably be a few months before the 3 years to prevent the bleeding. New implant stopped the bleeding. No problems with weight gain or loosing weight on Nexplanon.""",0
"""I had the Paragard IUD for 6 months, I chose this particular birth control because it has no horomones! My experience getting the device inserted was smooth.. it didn't hurt at all, but there was indeed some pressure! I was sore for about 3 days, my periods stayed the same, and everything was normal.. the only thing I would point on though was I kept having a strong cramp in my tail bone and sex was quite uncomfortable! Other then that this birth control gave me no other problems.""",0
"""I was on the Ortho Evra patch for a couple years and after the first 3 months of your body adjusting to it, (which you are forewarned about) just regular side effects, mood swings, regular cramps (when your time is almost near) and I believe it gave me a high sex drive. I've been off of it for about 5 months and my sex drive plummeted dramatically. It's extremely convenient due to my forgetting to take the pill everyday. I usually put it on my pelvis and rotate sides each week.""",0
"""I love it. No side effects. My periods have only been when I regulate them with pills. I have been on it for a year and 9 months and I'm not pregnant.""",0
"""I absolutely loved this IUD. I was skeptical at first, being that I hopped on the internet and started reading reviews and pretty much all I saw were people saying how bad the pain was getting it inserted and that the pain was worse to get it removed. The pain getting it inserted was NOT as bad as I was expecting. It literally just was a cramp that was a smidge more painful than I was use to. Besides that, the insertion was not bad. I cramped/bled for about a month then after that my periods started to slowly lighten up and now 3 years later I basically have no period (which is awesome considering before my IUD I had the worst periods). I recommend Skyla to everyone.""",0
"""Hello everyone! I just want to share some experience with the use of Mirena. I have had it for almost 6 months. I was recommended by my healthcare provider of this option since it is safe and suit with my situation. I am 27 years old now and have no kids. In the process of putting it in, it was very painful since I have never had kids, so my cervix is not as wide as ones who did. I had bad cramps for about a week and period for almost a month. Since then, I have some spotting as well as cramps. The cramp is not as bad as I used to have when I was on period. I don't think I have other side effects such as acne or weight gain. I recommend it to you. To me, it is more of psychological fix! Worry free!""",0

"""I've been on Ortha Evra & Xulane for going on 6 years now. They switched to the off-brand a few years ago and I never noticed a difference. I haven't had any complications or bad side effects from it. The only thing I've noticed is if I quit taking it, my period quits coming. I just recently tried to stop in January, my period came that month. Skipped February completely, and passed my period date for this month. So I got back on it to hopefully regulate it out again. Not sure what to do if I wanna stop taking it and try to get pregnant again tho.""",0
"""I LOVE IT. I had Implanon implanted early September 2011 and had a little bit of spotting for the first 3 weeks and that was it. As for the procedure, I HATE NEEDLES. I had the doctor distract me for the whole process and I still fainted (haha oops) the procedure wasn't as bad as I may have made. It just seems with my fainting (I'm just a wuss),  it was fast and basically painless. My periods have completely stopped. I love not worrying about having to take a pill every day. Overall I am very happy with Implanon!

"""I'm 17 & I've been on the patch for 4 months now. Before this I had been on the pill for a few years but it started to become inconvenient. The patch is VERY convenient for me. I've tried quite a few birth controls for my heavy and painful periods but nothing has ever worked. The patch hasn't made too much of a difference in that area but my skin is clear & I'm definitely protected from pregnancy.  The first two months my period was really bad but it got better. I'm happy with the patch and I recommend it.  One downside is the color of it though. I'm African American so my skin is brown and the patch is kind of pink like a Bandaid. No big deal though.""",0
"""I love Apri. A friend recommended Apri and as soon as I picked up my prescription that is when my love affair with Apri began. Prior to taking Apri, I had severe PMS (irregular periods, depression 1 week before and 1 week after my period, horrible cramps, acne) so my doctor suggested a birth control to help regulate my PMS symptoms. After taking Apri, my acne has completely cleared up, no weight gain, 3 day periods with light bleeding, and no depression. I haven't noticed increased bust size and no change in my sexual desires. I do have increased discharge. But that would be the only bad side effect.""",0
"""I decided to read the reviews for Mirena after I got it.  Wow am I ever glad I waited!  Reviews that stated spotting for months, and painful intercourse, would have been enough to put me off for sure.

However, I've had a fantastic experience with Mirena so far.  Spotted for 1.5 days (not months - DAYS) with only mild cramping.  Intercourse after 3 days, and it was as enjoyable, if not more so than before.

As I understand, it's better to have had children before using Mirena.  I can see why - insertion would likely have been more painful had I not had 1 child.

High recommendations, but of course, your doctor will know if Mirena is your best choice.  Right down to the tilt of your uterus - there are many factors to take into consideration.""",0
"""I just had Nexplanon placed 6/4/13. The process was simple enough, the only pain I felt was the numbing process, then just tugging sensations as the Doctor placed the insert.

I haven't had any adverse side effects, only itching which I assume is my arm healing.

I didn't even get my bleeding back (just a little right afterwards). Yeah! May advice:
 if you choose the Mirena be patient - the first year I constantly bleed off and on but then my period disappeared. Find a doctor who has done this a lot - I believe experience is the key!

I had it inserted at the end of my period. My period has been very regular, coming in once a month. I did have a little spotting, each time about a week before my period for a few days. But it would stop, I'd have a bit of a break, and then I would have a period for 2-3 days. No weight gain. My mood is fine. No increase in acne. However, I tend to react well to hormonal birth control (no side effects with the pill or Plan B).""",0

I laid there for about 25 mins feeling sick and having terrible cramping. Soon after I was fine! Mild cramping for the first few days and then for the next week (lessened over time). I bled for about three weeks after insertion- different everyday. Sometimes more than others. Just had my first cycle while on Skyla.

THE PROCEDURE: was easy. The Lidocane stings like burning nettles, the rest was easy. Only had a tiny bruise and a tiny scar from the needle (which looks like a mole honestly). 
Side Effects: Only one I've had is achy breasts. Like you don't even want people near them in case they bump into them. All my friends on Implanon have experienced the same thing.

I had some pretty bad mood swings for the first few months, and figured I just needed to be patient, but instead, it got much worse and became full blown depression. While that's not good, I am prone to depression, and the implant amplified it, but didn't cause it.

I have a tendency towards some mild anxiety (It is not severe and I choose to not take medication) but not depression, so I could deal with these symptoms (sort of) and figured that I'd ask about switching at my yearly OB/GYN visit. Almost a week before I went though, it was like a switch was flipped. Now it's like I'm not even on a medication.

They were horrendous vision-impairing headaches.  With Seasonique (same medication combination), I only have this dip every three months.  Fantastic!  Sometimes I get my 2-day headache from hell right before my period, sometimes I can avoid it.  Seasonique literally keeps me from missing work due to migraines.""",0

I do experience breast tenderness around the time of my menstrual period (which by the way is regular.. 3-5 days a month) and that only lasts as long as the menstrual cycle itself. The one bad thing I can say about Implanon is that is has severely decreased my sex-drive. Overall I'm happy.""",0

If you are sick of remembering to take a pill every day, have a long-term monogamous partner, and have nasty hormone side affects (I got migraines and crazy mood swings on the pill), Skyla is a great switch.

After a week of taking it, I was severely depressed for a day and a half, to the point where I considered seeking professional help, then I remembered that depression was a side effect. However, that was the only negative side effect I've had. My periods have come like clockwork, and my cramps are not nearly as bad as they used to be.

I'm switching to a pill with a little bit more estrogen in it to see if that will regulate my period better.

I haven't missed any pills, and I take them within two hours of one another everyday. I was initially really worried about nausea being an issue, so I take them at night - but I've had no problems. I did have some breast tenderness for the first few months, but it's gone now.""",0

This way I could see how my body reacted to this form of contraception for 1 month but it would be easier to come off it if I didn't get on very well.

I've been on this birth control for about three months. It has cleared my skin like no other birth control pill I've used before. Another positive side effect as a result of taking Sprintec has been my breasts. I've gone up an entire cup size, with very little weight gain elsewhere. Cons: nausea.
