"""I have been on this birth control for one cycle. After reading some of the reviews on this type and similar birth controls I was a bit apprehensive to start. Im giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as I have not been on it long enough for a 10. So far I love this birth control! My side effects have been so minimal its like Im not even on birth control! I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great! I got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and I had no idea it was coming because I had zero pms! My period was very light and I barely had any cramping! I had unprotected sex the first month and obviously didn't get pregnant so I'm very pleased! Highly recommend""",0
"""I was on this pill for almost two years. It does work as far as not getting pregnant however my experience at first was it didn't make a huge difference then 6 or 7 months into it my sex drive went down, along with being very very dry, my moodiness increased drastically. I would cry one second and then get angry with my husband over anything and everything. My skin has gotten a lot worse, I broke out in places I never had in the last week. So now I am on Yaz.""",1
"""I absolutely love this product and recommend to everyone. I know everyone's body is different, so it is not for everyone, but it is not the medicines fault. I have NO negative symptoms since I started this. I used to have heavy periods, terrible cramps and headaches, and my periods were super long. I now have super consistent 3-4 LIGHT periods, no cramps or headaches. I have been on this pill for over a year now and have no desire to switch.""",0
"""I'm absolutely DONE taking this horrible birth control! I've  been taking Aubra for a month and a half... I'm moody, irritable, depressed, hungry, bitchy... vaginal discharge has changed  (gross), my urine smells, my acne has gotten so out of hand and it's STUBBORN. Cystic acne all around my mouth, jawline, Chin and neck. After doing some research online, I discovered I'm not the only one. Birth control is different for everyone but this is going in the trash... I will not be taking this any longer. It also kills your sex drive... as for the difference in bleeding, I wouldn't know. I started this pill on day 1 of menstrual cycle last month and haven't had a period yet... have had plenty of headaches though! """,1
"""I started on the oral contraceptive pill but got horrible nausea and vomiting, so this was my next option. NuvaRing has been fantastic, it has a fraction of the hormones and I get no nausea. Insertion and removing is really not a hassle, and you cannot feel it at all. For me, it beats the pill and vomiting, along with all the other symptoms. I haven't had any noticeable mood issues or migraines. I would recommend it to anyone!""",0
"""About two months ago I had to switch from LoLestrin Fe to microgestin due to my insurance and pharmacy. Since starting microgestin I've noticed insane bloating and nausea and weird discharge. While on lolestrin, my periods consisted of spotting and average side effects, nothing too serious, but after one month of micro I got my period and it was heavy and the cramping was so painful I had to leave my class. I've also noticed I've developed bad depression and my mood swings are very intense. My anxiety is bad and my sex drive is very low if not nonexistent anymore. It helped with my acne but I'm a lot more paranoid about getting pregnant than I was on lolestrin. I'm going to be talking to my doctor about possibly getting the shot.""",1
"""I've had this birth control for a year now and at first things were going good, I only had a period once and never had one since but now I have super bad anxiety, I would constantly think I was pregnant, would waste my money on pregnancy test even though I am NOT pregnant and my depression was very bad and honestly , I really don't think it's worth it at all. I'm getting it removed tomorrow and I most likely am going to have to be in therapy.""",1
"""I started off by taking regular Ortho Tri Cyclen, which helped some with my acne, but I also became severely depressed, so I went off it.  After a year and a half of not taking birth control at all, I began taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for acne, and after 4 months my skin is MUCH clearer.  If I do get pimples, they are much smaller and more shallow than before, and go away quicker.  I am pleased!""",0
"""honestly the measurement hurt more than the actual placement! And I'm so happy I went through with it!!! I wish I didn't read all of these reviews before I did it. Pain is subjective and its not that bad. They explained the procedure to me and I felt more comfortable. I've never had kids. Its just like getting a regular pap. I think it is the best option of birth control. That being said I will definitely recommend getting this! Do expect cramping for a day or two. I didnt cramp until about three hours after having it done. I took ibuprophen and slept with a heating bad. Very mild cramping today but I am happy with my choice :)""",0
"""I was started on Gildess 1/20 but then was switched to Blisovi as Gildess was recalled. I always had the clearest skin and now that I've been taking Blisovi I'll have random break outs and I've gained some weight as well. I do not recommend. I can't wait to talk to my gynecologist to switch ASAP.""",1
"""I had paragard for a year and a half and had cramping the whole time with terrible long heavy periods.  The last couple months I had it I was in so much pain I could hardly walk. Went to my doc and she said nothing seemed wrong.  Then the next day I went to the ER and had it removed. It had slipped a little and was causing a lot of discomfort. I will never get an IUD again. I'm lucky I didn't need surgery like some women""",1
"""I just started taking this birth control about 12 days ago when I started my period, and I'm still bleeding as if I'm still on my period. The flow is light however the length of my average period is 2 weeks when I wasn't on birth control. So maybe the medication is altering my system %u2026I do feel nauseous and I crave like crazy. I do feel a little depressed because my period isn't gone yet but overall it 
seems to be a good birth control so far. """,0
"""I read so many bad experiences and horror stories about this pill, I was terrified. I am now on my second week of Aviane and have no symptoms.""",0
"""This is the third day I've had skyla and so far my experience has been excellent. I'd suggest taking ibuprofen all throughout the day and put a heating pad on your stomach (what i did). The procedure was uncomfortable and painful (i cried) but so far, extremely worth it. The day after I got it the bleeding significantly reduced, and today it's hardly bleeding. First day was the worst but definitely doable. As far as being emotional. The first day I was very irritable but I'm assuming it was because I was hurting and hungry all day. Other than that I've been great!""",0
"""I went in to have my Skyla placed yesterday morning. After reading all of these reviews I was hyperventilating and crying on my way there, bc I did not want to experience ""the worst pain of my life"". However, it was a complete waste of tears and energy. Before the procedure, I started doing heavy breathing, similar to pregnancy breaths, bc I was so nervous and I can tell you I felt NOTHING. There was a little bit of pressure, but nothing compared to what I've read on here. Probably a 2/10. It was over in 30 seconds, and as soon as she was done, the pressure vanished. I was shocked. I went to work from 5:45-11:30, & I managed with mild cramping.I cant speak for long term yet, but don't let other women scare you out of this, its very worth it!""",0
"""BC from below. Rapid weight gain, swelling and bad cycle. Don't recommend""",1
"""Switched from my old BC to yaz and immediately felt a difference the first few days I was SO  emotional. VERY significantly so. By the end of the first week I was full on depressed and it continued on to the second week. Everything triggered me. :(  but I like the sticker on the top with the days.""",1
"""I have had my Paragard for one year, and it's been great! Insertion was not pleasant, but it only lasts a moment and now it's nothing but a distant memory. My periods were heavier and my cramps more severe for the first three months, but after that they returned to nearly the same as before. So many people wrote about their terrible experiences that reading up almost stopped me from doing it, and now I'm so glad I got it anyway. Just remember that those who had a negative experience are more likely to post about it, so there's a bias! It's also totally possible that it will go just fine and be a fantastic BC method. Don't be too afraid to try it and see if it's right for you, you can always take it out if it's not.""",0
"""I love Jolessa. I have no periods for three months and little to no side effects. I was on Depo for eleven years and due to insurance changes had to change to the pill.""",0
"""I had the implant placed a little over 1 month ago. After about a week I started breaking out with acne. I feel extremely irritable, emotional, and have extreme insomnia. I keep getting the chills but it's been 80 degrees outside for weeks. I'm a fit person, but I've started having unexplained joint pain. I'm so exhausted.. I was really hoping this birth control method was going to be the best choice for me. I never remembered to take the pill, I had frequent infections with the IUD because my body didn't like the strings/foreign body in there. I'm hoping these side effects will gradually lessen or go away because it's really effecting my quality of life. I'm going to try to give it a few more months..""",1
"""Ive been on this pill for 9 months now and I love it! I have severe migraines so it is hard to find a birth control that doesnt make them 10x worse. My migraines have almost disappeared since I started this pill! Also, I had one period upon starting the pills and I havent had one since. In the beginning of my trial, I did go through some changes. I was moody all the time, my breasts stayed sore to the extent that I could hardly move around. Other than that, I had no issues. I havent had any weight changes, acne changes or anything like that. My body returned to better than normal after maybe three months. Mood changes disappeared, no period, no cramps, no soreness. Overall I am satisfied!""",0
"""I've been on this birth control for a year and I have to say that it's very practical for my body. I used to get brutal cramps and long periods. No matter what type of birth control I had debilitating cramps. Lolo has caused my cramps to stop and my period is consistent and lasts 2 days. Only downside is I did get some acne, but the acne may be just due to something else since I've dealt with breakouts prior to trying lolo. Also my boobs grew a lot which I'm happy about. This medication is not for everyone, if you experience adverse effects stop taking it immediately as it does not agree with every woman.""",0
"""I have been using this method of Birth Control for over ten years now, I am hesitant to change to another form. I have not had a period since starting Depo and never had a pregnancy scare. I have gained weight while on the shot but it could be just my eating habits and lack of exercise! I would recommend this form of birth control for anyone who cannot remember to take a pill or who does not want to worry about getting pregnant. Once every three months is easy to do and I have never been happier with any form of birth control.""",0
"""I got nexplanon February 2015 at first my period was every 2 month which I loved. They are normal now. December 2015 I started gaining weight which I thought was just holiday so January I started exercising and lost 15 of the 30 pounds since I gained 10 back and and can't lose anything I diet exercise when ever my boyfriends not looking (I don't feel comfortable in front of him) and he's noticed the weight we got in a fight and he actually slipped up and called me fat. And said all I do is sit on my ass that's why I gained it. But I also got so depressed and cried over everything panic attacks every day and thought of self harm. The depression is gone now for the weight. I like it would give 10 stars except the depression and weight.""",0
"""I just got paragard not too long ago. And it was actually not as bad as I thought it would be. There was not excruciating pain at all. Just cramping. Anyone wanting to get it should most definitely do so. It's not as bad as some may say, but everyone reacts to things differently.""",0
"""I am 21 years old and have been on Depo-Provera for almost two years while in a four year committed relationship. My doctor recommended Depo-Provera for me because I suffer from chronic migraines so any birth control with a high level of estrogen would most definitely make my migraines worse. So far, I have to say I am pleased with my experience while on the depo shot. The side effects I have experienced have thankfully been able to be fixed/altered. Such as slight weight gain which I help to control with diet and exercise. Loss of sex drive which my longtime boyfriend is more than happy to help with. And I tend to start spotting around the time that my next shot is due. Once I receive the depo shot, within hours the spotting stops.""",0
"""I had terrible experiences on Alesse & Ortho Tri Cyclen so my doctor recommended Skyla (Jaydess in Canada) over Mirena for me because it's both smaller & releases a lower hormone amount since it lasts 3 years vs. 5 for Mirena. After reading the reviews here I was worried but wanted to try it anyway. There was a HUGE cramp after she measured my uterus & inserted the IUD, what I imagine a contraction feels like. I had lots of cramping afterwards for 2 weeks & on & off spotting for the first 3 months but that's all gone now. I'm really happy with Skyla, but every body is different.



Pros: shorter, lighter periods; no mood swings; no weight gain; no acne; no loss of sex drive

Cons: slightly worse pre-period cramps; occasional post sex cramping""",0
"""I aImost didn't go through after reading these reviews. I have had Liletta for about 2 months. I have no tolerance for pain whatsoever. I took a tramadol 2 hours before my appointment. My doctor advised that it would be painful for a short while especially since I have never been pregnant. She was very good during the insertion about letting me know when pain would occur. It was very painful for about 3-4 hours. After that, it was similar to my normal cramps for 2 days. I spotted for the first 4 days just enough for a panty liner, not even a pad, and have not had any spotting since. I have had no issues with my boyfriend and the strings or being dry ""down there"" as I have read with some others. My sex drive has increased since having it.""",0
"""I am 22 and I been on since I was 21, I havent had a period since I have been on, which is fine but my sex drive is out the window. Haven't had sex with my boyfriend in 6 weeks and we live together. I'm just not in the mood AT ALL. Also I notice I have been dry and that has never been the case. Also a lot of weight gain and no matter how much I exercise it wont come off. I also feel like my feet keeps growing. Its perfect for effectiveness but its the price you pay so to each its own. Different bodies react different ways so my story may not be yours.""",0
"""I went on this pill when I got into my first serious relationship.  I've tried other birth control pills before and had to go off of them because of weight gain. When I finally got back on the pills, I thought it was great because my periods were always regular, I had no weight gain, and my skin was flawless.  But, after being on it for 6 months now I'm realizing that this pill is the reason for my poor mental health.  I went from being happy and satisfied with my life, to being an actual crazy person.  I started lashing out at the people I loved as the months progressed. I would have the worst mood swings of my life.  I would be happy and laughing, and the next minute I was in tears.  It turned me into an angry person that I didn't know.""",1
"""I switched to FE 1/20 from Sprintec birth control and it's been nothing but hell. I don't know if it's my body that's reacting so negatively or what but I hate this birth control. It hasn't even been a full month and I'm already on the urge of losing my mind. I've been crying almost everyday, snapping at people feeling depressed and hated..it's unreal. I've never been so sad in my life. My headache also gotten much worse than before. The only positive is it made my boobs bigger and period lighter.""",1

"""I started taking Aviane when I was 16 1/2 and I've been on it ever since. I'm now 21 and about to discontinue my use of Aviane. It caused me to be emotional almost all the time, I have very little patience, moods swings, I gained weight, it's tough to lose weight, I have constant headaches and my acne is horrible to the point of scarring. Since I was taking this birth control through the toughest of teenage years, I just thought this was who I became. But after doing research and finding this website, I now know I'm not the only one who has suffered through taking Aviane. It did its job with preventing pregnancy, but didn't help with my heavy period and painful cramps. I'm finishing my current pack and it'll be my last.""",1
"""This is the first and only birth control medication I've been on. I've been taking it a little over 2 years now. I've had no side-effects besides EXTREMELY low sex drive. I've never had a particularly high sex drive but now it's nonexistent. I haven't had any of the headaches or mood swings. There was a mild increase in my acne but I'm also a college student so I don't particularly lay all the blame on the pill. Overall, it does it's job but I would caution potential takers with low libido.""",0
"""The first month was bad. Breakthough bleeding.. cramping and bloating.. mood swings. But the second month was perfectly fine. I'm going onto my 3rd month now. Once my body got used to it everything was perfect. I love not having to remember to take a pill each day! This is so easy!""",0

I have been working out more and couldn't figure out what was going on until now. I am dry during sex, not in the mood most of the time. Acne has been pretty bad, didn't know why that was either (don't usually have acne). For a few weeks now my body feels like it is pregnant. The moods, tired, etc.... but all tests say not pregnant. It makes me uncomfortable to have so many things going on.""",1
"""So I got my skyla inserted and it was honestly the worst pain of my entire life. My doctor had told me that I would feel some cramping but during and especially after I could not even breathe. I sat up after it was over and started sweating, my ears started to ring and I then passed out! When I woke up I was in the worst pain I have ever felt. I drove myself to the doctor but I had to have someone come get me because I couldn't even stand up. The rest of the day I had extreme cramping. Still debating on whether to take it out or not because it doesn't feel comfortable.""",1
"""I got this for the same reason as everyone else, because I hate taking the pill. I must say I give it a 10 for birth control considering I'm constantly on my period, so I can't have sex anyway. It's been three months that I've been on my period, and the constant bleeding caused a bacterial infection which then led to problems with UTIs. I am miserable, but my doctor made me sign an agreement saying I couldn't get it removed because of period problems, so now I'm stuck. I would not suggest this product to anyone who plans on having sex in the next six months or doesn't want to pay to constantly buy pads or tampons. It is becoming expensive and not worth all of this hassle.""",1

A couple of months ago, I had a new one inserted after months of my husband complaining about the strings poking him. I don't know what made me look into it, but I realized that over the past 4 years I have gained over 35lbs.,my sex drive is almost non-existent, I am often dry during intercourse.

I was never like this and I've become an emotional beast using this and it has effected the relationship I'm currently in.

The most frustrating part was that I called my doctor's office several times, only to be told that while my experience wasn't typical, I had to give it more time. I wanted to have it taken out, but kept hoping that things might get better. I still have it in. My periods are a little more normal now, but start really early with spotting for days before the regular flow starts. It certainly hasn't stopped my periods.""",1

I am now a solid 125lbs, sometimes more. I have not changed my fairly healthy diet and do lightly excercise. My skin has not cleared up and my sex drive is gone.

They then switched my birth control pill again. It stopped for a couple months and when it started back up again my doctor put me on an estrogen pill cause from me being on the 2 birth controls for so long I had a thick lining around my uterus and it was trying to thin out.

They were horrendous vision-impairing headaches.  With Seasonique (same medication combination), I only have this dip every three months.  Fantastic!

I will always get it on a Tuesday night and lasts only 2-3 days with light spotting and very little cramping. I've also dropped a good 15lbs!

Con: I have noticed some weight gain. After receiving the implant on Dec 6, it is now Jan 7 and I have gained about 3-4 lbs. This makes me a little nervous, as I feel this could easily spiral out of control quickly. I'm afraid to think of what the scale will say in another month.""",0

Here's a short on my experience! I've never taken any kind of prescribed medication or pills anything like that, I was so scared. The first few months on Sprintec was HELL.

2mo later everything cleared up. I'm back to my normal self. I am a little more sensitive to things, I may cry over something I haven't cried over before the pill. But everything has been just fine.

-I've had some spotting off and on since I got the Nexplanon. It's more annoying than anything else. But it is REALLY annoying.""",0

I have gained 15 pounds and it's extremely noticable. All I crave is junk food. I'm way more irritable. And all the time. The week before my period is horrible. I often get bad PMS before my period.

It was light in volume, but lasted for almost 10 days. It was odd to say the least, but not as bad as I had been told it would be.

I have really enjoyed the lighter hormone load: I had previously used the pill, which made me gain a bit of weight and also lowered my libido to non-existent (I guess the birth control was two-fold in that respect). This, so far, has been much better.""",0

"""I got my Skyla IUD 5 months ago. I am 18 and have never had a child. I liked the idea of the IUD because I didn't have to remember to take it, it was there for three years, it was the most effective, and because there was an option to have an IUD without hormones. I struggle with depression and anxiety and I was afraid that hormonal birth control would only make matters worse. However, because of all of the terrible period stories I had heard about it, at the last minute I had my OBGYN switch to Skyla. The insertion did not take long at all and amid horror stories, the pain wasn't unbearable. It didn't feel great, but it was well worth it. If the fear of insertion is what drives you away from this option, don't let that happen! Before my IUD my periods were like clockwork, every four weeks, five days, no cramps- perfect. Afterward, I still don't get cramps, some periods have been really light, but I have had a period that was over a week late and one that was two weeks long. This is to be expected in the first few months. I do not believe that it has had any influence on my depression/anxiety, at least not monumental. I haven't gained weight, lost my sex drive or any other negative symptoms. My partner has finished inside of me multiple times and nothing has happened. Also, he cannot feel the strings.

The insertion was quick, simple and painless. I had a small bruise which was easily covered and went away quickly. I have a tiny scar the size of a pen tip now.

During the first 3-4 months, my period was a bit erratic. It would last about 6-7 days and it would sometimes come once a month, sometimes more or less. It was much lighter than my natural periods. I took naproxen which would stop the bleeding most of the time. However after about six months my period has basically stopped. Occasionally I have an hour or so of spotting, and rarely I might have a few days in a row. One liner a day is always enough for the bleeding now. I have no period pain for the first time in my life.

I haven't experienced any weight gain, and my acne is no worse than when I was on the pill.

You can't beat the ease of this thing. In Australia, it cost about $50 (including insertion by a doctor) for three years protection. I often go weeks without thinking about contraception. I don't even have to worry about pregnancy, knowing this is the most effective contraception available.

Afterwards, I did spot for an hour or so & the cramps were outrageous. I had meds and a heating pad to help, and eventually they went away.

BUT when I did have my period, I had no cramps or back pain, it was astonishing. It was light too. It was like I wasn't on my period at all. I did experience very mild cramps at the very end 1-2 out of 10 pain wise. If you don't like the idea of taking a pill & are new to birth control my advice is try it. It's the closest experience you'll get of having a regular period (Keeping track of it).""",0

My gyno was really good. She had me take Misoprostol before hand and 800 mg ibuprofen. The insertion was quick but yes, painful. She had me keep taking the pills the next month, then did a follow up with ultrasound to check on things.

I also did gain a little weight (like 5 pounds) but it was probably due to a stressful lifestyle and not so healthy eating choices. and the best thing, I haven't gotten my period since before I got this.

However, some side affects I've gone through we're mood swings and irregular menstrual cycle. The downfall about this implant is that I have my period more often than I did when I wasn't on birth control. I don't regret at all about getting birth control because it effective, no kids!""",0

Cons: getting hormonal acne (I have never had acne growing up until now at 23...) , random periods that you can&rsquo;t predict (even at 9 months it will come for 3 weeks even and go away for a long time- it&rsquo;s annoying), expensive

At this point I wouldn't advise bc at all but obviously people use it for other reasons besides getting pregnant. Nevertheless, the hormonal imbalance and emotional toll is not worth it!

The first month was a study in misery but after that my periods stopped and it's been a breeze with some occasional light cramping and spotting.

The most notable and stable difference comes after the 6 month mark. My body and facial hair grow back thinner and at a much slower pace, my mood is very stable and I don't lose anywhere the same amount of hair from my scalp.

I also have easy and comfortable periods and my appetite is very stable on Yasmin, which I can't say about other pills. I haven't put on any weight as a result.



The first 2 weeks of being on Yasmin can be difficult (nausea, headaches) and I don't recommend it for very sedentery/very unfit ladies, as the risk of clotting is slightly higher because of its Drospirenone content.""",0

My Dr has told me that naturally I am very small and tight (I tore when I gave birth to my son) so that was a contributing factor in the pain. I look at it like getting a tattoo or piercing; 10 minutes (not even) worth of pain for 3 years of knowing you are safe. It was worth it to me.""",0

But one day, it did and it retrospect I'd do it over again to reap the benefits I'm currently experiencing. It's just something you have to tough out.

1. This IUD does not cause acne, but it lacks estrogen like the pill or other forms of birth control that help with clearing up acne. So you may get more pimples than usual but its what you would normally have with out the pill.

I ummed and erred for months because of negative reviews and my concerns were:
1) Would insertion hurt? The answer was no, I've had more painful cervical smears than the insertion of my mirena coil.
2) Would it mess with my monthly cycle? Yes, it did. I bled constantly, (in an array of colours!) for the obligatory 3 months that the GP told me to wait, until my body got used to it. Then it was another month before I finally went back to my GP and said ""Help"". She gave me a progesterone pill told me to take it for a month. I only took it for only one week! It did the job, I stopped bleeding and have gone on to a normal cycle. My periods only last a couple of days, do not hurt and are light, (just a smear of blood).

4) Would I loose my sex drive? No, not so far. I was worried about this, however I am happy to say that I have noticed no difference. Sex is just as welcome and enjoyable as before.
5) Would I get spots? No. The doctor told me that this was less likely because the hormonal content is tiny and localised to the womb. She was right.

I started to think weirdly I started to think I didn't love my boyfriend anymore.  And I know it's not true but it is the WORST. I went off it about a month ago and I still have the worst depression and anxiety. I can't even look at my boyfriend the same anymore and it breaks my heart. But I heard it gets better and these thoughts will go away. Remember ladies  never act when your on birth control it's not you! But this made my realtionship the worst.  So I needed a break from birth control after this one a break is well needed! 

Good luck ladies!""",1

My doctor informed me that about 5% of Skyla users will stop getting a monthly period. I have gained15 pounds!

I told my doctor I was nervous of how awful it was going to feel and he assured me that it was all in my head.  He was right, it was nothing like the reviews I have read. I counted how long it took, it was less than 2 minutes.  AND I counted how long the severe cramping lasted during, and that was less than 20 seconds.  Yes the cramps felt like a very powerful menstrual cramp and it was not comfortable, but it was so so so short.  I left the office feeling completely fine, just feeling like I had menstrual cramps.  Very little spotting the next few days.  Don't let the reviews scare you!""",0

It was also very painful to extract---it took over an hour of a scalpel and tweezers in my arm before it finally came out. I understand that I may have had an especially bad experience with this, but be warned that it's possible. This implant is amazing if you want to be sick and suicidal.

My only con is that it invariably caused vaginal dryness. Prior to using this, I didn't have problems with arousal or lubrication (I'm in my mid-20s). With this, I immediately noticed that I felt pain and stinging in my vagina after sex. This sometimes caused me to lose interest in sex in anticipation of the pain.

I was nervous about getting it inserted but the whole process is a breeze, so if you are considering it don't worry about that! For 2 months, I bled almost every day but it wasn't bad. As time went on, it was less and less. I've read other reviews where they said they bleed everyday and was horrified about that happening to me, but it was hardly noticeable. Sex wise- I haven't gotten pregnant and this is the only form of protection my boyfriend and I use.

Some people only stay on it for a month or two before switching because they are not happy with the side effects but do not realize they disappear over time.

- after one week I had continuous breakthrough bleeding due to the low amount of progesterone in the pill

-my period are now irregular. Last month it was 4 days early, this month its 3 days (or more) late

The insertion process was painful for me being I've never had kids so the dr. manually opening my cervix to insert the iud was the worst part. Following the procedure, a friend took me home because of the cramping it caused but after a couple hours I felt okay to drive. There was spotting for a month and slowed down to the point I now spot maybee 2 days a month. I've now had it for 5 months and get cramps from time to time but they arent bad ones. I think my body is still adjusting some. I would overall suggest it to those who are preventing pregnancy more than preventing periods and cramps.""",0

I did bleed quite a bit after insertion because he had to pry everything open basically lol. But really not a bad experience. I rated it at an 8 because I've been bleeding since about day 5 post insertion.

It's not as cheap as a generic pill, but wonderful not to worry about missing a dose. The patch sticks on fine, and adhered again well if caught on a slipped bra strap when I wore on my outer arm. I'm now wearing on my butt and it's fine. It will leave a mark that doesn't easily come off for days and is prone to picking up lint on the sides, but I am okay with that. No weight gain, moodiness or other issues. May have had a pimple or two in the first months, short nausea with the very first application, and heavier periods with additional but slight cramping. My sex drive dropped for a time but has returned to normal and I have no problems there. I think I feel a bit low emotionally the week it's off. Overall, no concerns I can't live with, and I love the easy protection and confidence of seeing it on.""",0

Firstly, she clamped me open and measured me up (look up the process if you don't know what I'm going on about) this was slightly uncomfortable, but very bearable. She then pinched on my cervix which wasn't painful at all. Then the coil was placed. The whole process took 6-7 minutes. It wasn't painful just slightly uncomfortable.

Another bonus is that it helps with my depression and daily fatigue which was something I wasn't expecting.

Not worth crying over, but definitely painful. My arm hurt for like a week after the initial implant. I kept my arm wrapped, for more cushion and support. If I would move my arm a certain way I would feel a sharp pain shooting in my arm. After about a week the swelling and bruising went down and no more sharp pains. I had no other side effects. No emotional changes, no weight gain, no acne, ect. Minor abdominal cramping, but that's it (:""",0

PROS:

-No weight gain

-No extreme mood swings

-No decrease in sex drive

-Easy to use

-Effective

-Less premenstrual cramps, shorter periods



CONS:

-For the first few days of the pill, I felt extremely nauseous. It was so bad that I considered giving it up, but I am glad I didn't as the nausea went away after the first week. 

-I now experience headaches before my expected period""",0

The shot as COMPLETELY stopped my period. Which is quite amazing. The only reason why I'm not giving the shot a 10 is because of the weight gain.

I got the implant inserted on the second day of my period and the bleeding stopped the same day.

So heavy I had to wear a pad and a jumbo tampon and change every 2 hours HORRIBLE cramping to where my only relieve was laying in bed curled up with heating pad. Midol/Tylenol rarely made a difference. Around my time of PMS I would suddenly feel very very depressed and sooo fatigue.

It took me about 8 months until my period completely disappeared. From September and onward my periods were lighter. I DID experience some in between spotting, but it wasn't anything major and happened maybe 3 times tops and the spotting lasting for 2-4 days. Again, NOT major and NOT unusual.

At the beginning I barely had a period but at the end it was back to being the long and dreadful periods I once had.

After starting this prescription I have noticed a complete change. Headaches stopped I have an occasional migraine towards the beginning but could be caused from stress as well.

My last full period was about 4-5 months ago and that period was the longest I ever had lasting at least a week. Since then, no period. My moods are very high and very low.

I prefer to place the patch on the left or right of my stomach, just cause I feel it's more secure and less likely to peek out.

The cramps for the first two days afterwards were pretty bad, but 800mg of Ibuprofen worked well. It is now the third day, and the cramps are totally gone. I'm still spotting a little bit, nothing a panty liner can't handle. All in all, the discomfort was well worth it.""",0

During the procedure I did have A LOT of pain, (as expected), but nothing that was not bearable.

I decided to check on this and it was found that I formed a blood clot behind my knee. I was advised to stop Loryna immediately. I now have to take 2 shots a day of blood thinners for 3 to 6 months.

The downsides, I have tender breasts (not bad though), occasional nausea, and acne. I've never had acne before, but it is something I am able to control and deal with easily. OH!

I'm so emotional I can cry at any second over the smallest things and I get headaches all the time. The first week I took the pill I had no appetite and was sweating and hot every second. I know you are supposed to wait 3 months to let your body adjust to the birth control but it is not worth bleeding for over a week and the mood swings.""",1
"""I have had the implant for about two months now and I have not really had any problems except for strange bleeding patterns which I was told was to be expected for the first six months to a year. The only other thing that kind of bothered me was a weird bout of serious depression and irritability, but I just reminded myself my body is getting used to this new method. I had been using the depo shot since I was about 15 ( I am 20 now) and it's fairly similar. One thing I like is that I have not had any weight gain, but I've actually been able to lose weight fairly easy. I know it's early but I love it, and if I have any weird problems in the future I can just get it removed, which I like!""",0

"""I hate nexplanon so much. After the first month of getting it everything was fine, but I started my period. It was a semi normal cycle for me and it ended after nine days. Three days after it ended I started spotting brown stuff. After a month of that I went back to the doctor to see if they could do anything and they gave me the pill to cancel out the spotting. After two weeks of taking the pill I didn&rsquo;t stop bleeding so the doctor said take two pills and it finally stopped spotting. She said two days after you stop spotting stop taking the pills so I did. Then I got the heaviest period for 7 Days bleeding through 4 super plus tampons through out the day. I repeated the pill process and stopped and my period came back heavier.""",1
"""I was in 2 minds whether to change from the pill to the implant, I've always been quite bad with missing pills and I don't plan on having children any time soon so I thought the implant would be a good option. There are so many bad reviews which put me off however, my doctor reassured me that everyone is different and suggested that I try Cerazette, which is a Progestogen-only pill and is similar to the implant. This way I could see how my body reacted to this form of contraception for 1 month but it would be easier to come off it if I didn't get on very well. After the month I was really happy with Cerazette so I had the implant fitted. A year on I haven't had 1 period and no side effects, I'm so glad I went ahead and tried it.""",0

"""I first would like to thank all of you that posted comments. After reading them, I felt I'm not alone. It's not just happening to me, there is nothing wrong with me. I'm 34, with one child and had Mirena for 5 months. The insertion was almost painless and the first month was fine. Right now, I have gained 10lbs, loss of sex drive, have headaches, back pain, insomnia, constipation, hair loss and general depression - OF COURSE that's going to cause to have mood swings. I'm waiting on an appointment to have it removed. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT is that I had suffered from postpartum depression after the birth of my child 4 years ago and honestly I was worried that these side effects (especially  depression) were a sign that I was still not okay.""",1
"""I started taking Apri about 7 months ago. My breats got noticeably larger within the first few weeks and I gained about 10 pounds, but I'm a thin girl anyway so I gladly take on the extra few pounds and curves. I got prescribed this birth control because of my ovarian cysts and since I have not had any problems with them. They've been unnoticeable and my cramps don't even exist anymore. I love Apri and it's affordable. Just what I need in this economic clash.""",0
"""I'm married, 34 years old and I have no kids. Taking the pill was such a hassle so I decided to get the Mirena. It was very painful when it was inserted,then had cramping for the rest of that day! For the first 6 weeks I spotted off and on and then my periods just stopped. I still got cramps every few months, but never needed to take anything. The 5th and final year of me having Mirena, I started to spot monthly. I called my OB, they just said that the levonorgestrel wears off over time. I made the decision that I was going to have another one put in. Taking the old one out didn't hurt at all, you feel a little pressure. Inserting the new one was less painful but still uncomfortable. It's been 4 days and I still have a little cramping but overall HAPPY.""",0
